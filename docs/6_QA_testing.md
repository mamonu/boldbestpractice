# 6 QA & testing

Need to develop a set of tests to provide a proof that your functions work as intended

Testing framework libraries:
  - [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) in Python
  - [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) in R

Tests should be:
  - Fast & Independent
  
  - Repeatable (deterministic)
  
  - Self-validating (no manual steps)


  - Thorough (How much do you trust they cover everything?)


    - Coverage
