# 2 Use a clear layout structure


Use meaningful folder/file names

•	A README file at the root of the project

• Separate inputs, code & outputs

• Separate stand-alone scripts from
‘ad hoc’ exploratory code/notebooks .

• Have one place to go to:
• Find out more about the project
• Be able to rerun the analysis

Folder structure example: COOKIECUTTER 
https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/
No need to be as thorough though.

Similar for R: projecttemplate

http://projecttemplate.net/index.html
