# BOLD Best Practice Manifesto

BOLD has been set up as a central programme to drive data linking and realise this potential value for the country

## BOLD Aims

BOLD aims to enable better-evidenced, joined-up and more effective cross-government services to support and protect vulnerable adults at specific touchpoints in their interactions with government-funded services, supported by timely linked data and evidence.

## Aims for this best practice document

Once the number of people in a project / team gets bigger and new people join in it is always useful to have
a place to codify and make explicit all the little things that can make our lives easier when working with data 
and the code needed for analysis / linking / any other use. This is a "live" document that can be updated when it is decided
that something needs to be added so be sure to check it regularly / have it in your bookmarks.


## Structure of this best practice document

- Section [1](1_adhocscripts.md) is about just starting analytical projects using code         
- Section [2](2_reusable_code.md) is about not repeating ourselves and using reusable structures called functions              
- Section [3](3_clear_layout_structure.md) discusses about the importance of a clear layout structure.
- Section [4](4_coding_standards.md) presents recommended coding standards when coding and collaborating with others
- Section [5](5_version_control.md) shows examples of using version control to archive progress / collaborate
- Section [6](6_reproducible.md) points out different ways of making your analysis reproducible
- Section [7](7_QA_testing.md) talks about testing. An important step in order to ensure/prove the correctness of parts that form our analysis


## What to look for according to level

### Beginner level

It would be useful to start from the beginning and cover all sections

### Intermediate level

It would be useful to start from the section [3](3_clear_layout_structure.md), "Clear Layout Structure" and cover all subsequent sections

### Advanced level

It would be useful to start from the section [6](6_reproducible.md), "Reproducible Work" and cover all subsequent sections
