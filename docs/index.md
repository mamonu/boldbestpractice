## BOLD Aims


## Aims for this best practice document

Once the number of people in a project / team gets bigger and new people join in it is always useful to have
a place to codify and make explicit all the little things that can make our lives easier when working with data 
and the code needed for analysis / linking / any other use. This is a "live" document that can be updated when it is decided
that something needs to be added so be sure to check it regularly / have it in your bookmarks.
