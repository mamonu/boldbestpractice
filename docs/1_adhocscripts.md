• Everyone starts somewhere

• In exploratory mode, investigating, building familiarity. Jupyter notebooks. Single scripts

• Focus is on learning and reducing uncertainties. And automating / not doing things by hand.

    Project1.r  
    lastworkingcodeFINALFINAL.R 
    ITWORKKKSSSS.R

• Certainly not ready for sharing!
