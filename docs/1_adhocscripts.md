Everyone starts somewhere. This is usually every project in the beginning. 
Trying something out with perhaps hardcoded minimal inputs and outputs.


â€¢ Code may not be well named or organised:

    Project1.r  
    lastworkingcodeFINALFINAL.R 
    ITWORKKKSSSS.R


Certainly this is not work that will be ready for sharing! Hopwfully by following the next steps in the BOLD Best Practices Manifesto an
analyst will have some ideas on many factors that can be improved and all together create a project that is easy to collaborate with that is
also reusable and reproducible.

However, there are some ways that even in this stage work can be useful.

An analyst can work in an exploratory mode, investigating processes and building familiarity with the problem domain. 

By using technologies such as Jupyter notebooks (in Python/R) or knitr (R only)  natural language is used alongside the source code, a method also known as literate programming. This can help an analyst explain what a process does to other people or him/herself after 6 months (!)

Usually work in this step is comprised of single scripts and the focus is on learning and reducing uncertainties. Its an important first step on learning how to automate processes via programming and not doing things by hand / manually. Just be aware that there are better ways of organising this adhoc code.
These are going to be mentioned in the next step.
