The BOLD Best Practice project is opinionated, but not afraid to be wrong. 
Best practices change, tools evolve, and lessons are learned. 
The goal of this project is to make it easier to start, structure, and share an analysis. 

Pull requests and filing issues is encouraged. We'd love to hear what works for you, and what doesn't.
